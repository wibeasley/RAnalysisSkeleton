Headline
=============================================

<!-- The documentation page has two columns.  The test on the left, and the headline graph on the right. -->
This dashboard helps facilitate the CQI analyses VIHA E.C.R. (early cognitive recline) project.

Overall {.tabset data-width=300}
---------------------------------------------

<!-- left column -->
### Notes
1. The current report covers `r scales::comma(nrow(ds))` total subject-event records for `r dplyr::n_distinct(ds$county)` unique counties (`r paste(sort(unique(ds$county)), collapse=", ")`).
1. The year of collection ranges from `r min(ds$year, na.rm=T)` to  `r max(ds$year, na.rm=T)`.
1. The selected county is `r county_name_focus` (id value `r county_id_focus`).

### Explanation -Current PDSA

#### SMART Aim
By implementing plans for self-care activities with established clients, primary caregivers will see a mean score reduction of at least 4 points on the ECR after 4 months of self-care activities by Dec 1, 2018.

#### Measures 

* **Outcome**: Parent Stress
    * Pre- and Post- Parent Stress Scale score change
    
* **Process**: Completed Resiliency Plans
    * *Numerator*: Count of clients who completed their designated self-care activity
    * *Denominator*: Count of clients with a visist in a given week
    
* **Disruptor**: Cultural issues preventing participation, toxic stress, family catastrophe

#### Spaghetti Notes

* **To be added**:
    * Post score plots
    * Pre-post comparisons
    * Splitting out new clients from old clients to see if differences are more or less prominent

* **Mean PSS Scores - Pre**: 
    * Each blue dot represents a single client's PSS score on the pre measure
    * The orange dots (connected by the red line) represent the mean PSS score for all clients on a given week.
    * Dot size is proportional to the number of clients who had a pre-PSS score.

* **Stress Activity - Success**: 
    * *Numerator*: Number of clients who indicated having completed their self-care activity
    * *Denominator*: All clients who responded to the self-care question (Yes/No to self-care)
    * *Dot size*: The dot size is proportional to the number of clients who responded to that question on a given week.
