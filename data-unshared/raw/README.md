`data-unshared/raw` Directory
=========

In this directory, place the 'raw' files that come from the researcher/client.  Do not change anything in raw files; make these changes programmatically.  Request that updates/refreshes to this file strictly follow the same schema, so downstream code doesn't require changes.

Files in this directory are stored locally, but not staged/committed and sent to the central GitHub repository.  For more information, see [`data-unshared/README.md`](../../data-unshared/README.md).
