`documentation/irb/` Directory
=========

In this directory, include documentation from the IRB (institutional review board) that approves the study's protocol and personnel.  Delete the folder if an IRB is not involved with this project.

Make sure the documentation doesn't include passwords, PHI, or anything else that should remain private.  Even if the repository is private, we do NOT treat GitHub as HIPAA compliant (this is just our instinct, and not the official advice from a lawyer).
