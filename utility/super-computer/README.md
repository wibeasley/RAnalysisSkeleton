`utility/super-computer/` Directory
=========

The files in this directory support the April 2019 [SCUG](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing) presentation.

1. There are two files involved in a conventional operation.
    1. The R file that performs the data manipulation & analysis.
    1. The batch file that calls the R file and specific parameters specific to the super computer.
    
1. To run
    1. SSHing into schooner
    1. Set the working directory with `cd RAnalysisSkeleton`.
    1. Modify the batch file with `nano utility/super-computer/r-batch-hello.sh` (or `r-batch-repo.sh`). 
        * email address
        * working directory
    1. Submit the batch file with `sbatch utility/super-computer/r-batch-hello.sh` (or `r-batch-repo.sh`).  (Hint, use the keyboard's up arrow.)

1. This R file and shell file corresponds closely with OSCER's advice at http://ou.edu/oscer/support/R_package. The differences involve
    1. file naming.
        * The R file is called `hello-world.R`, instead of `helloworld.r`.
        * The batch shell file is called `r-batch-hello.R`, instead of `r_batch.sh`.
        * Both files are nested in the `utility/super-computer` directory (the root directory).
    1. a newer & explicit version of R.
        * The batch file specifies `module load R/3.5.1-intel-2016a` instead of just `module load R`.
        * [Inspect](https://www.ou.edu/oscer/support/running_jobs_schooner#module_avail) the available modules with `module avail`.
